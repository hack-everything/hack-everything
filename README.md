<h1 align=center>Hey there! I'm Sourfruit.</h1>

I do a bunch of shit and sometimes upload it to Github. I hack, I program and I sometimes engineer. I also definitely forgot these existed... In short:

I like using the programming languages listed below!

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E)
![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
